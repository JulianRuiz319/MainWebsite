      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Hello Everyone,
        My name is Julian Ruiz, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at National Louis University. My passion for this field sparked back in high school during a memorable visit from a cybersecurity professional. At the time, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect, but as they explained the concept of cyber threats and their mission to defend against these attacks, I was captivated. The idea of combating digital threats to protect individuals and organizations opened my eyes to the serious, impactful side of technology, and since then, I’ve been dedicated to learning more about cybersecurity and the wider field of computer science. </p>

      <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"> As a student, I am committed to giving my best to every challenge. If I encounter obstacles, I persevere and keep trying until I find a solution. Beyond technical skills, I bring strong communication abilities to my work, thanks to hands-on experience in both customer service and human services roles. I’ve had the opportunity to work in a restaurant setting, which sharpened my ability to communicate efficiently in fast-paced environments, and as a caretaker for elderly clients, where I learned the importance of empathy, patience, and clear communication.</p>

      <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"> With a growing foundation in computer science and a genuine commitment to cybersecurity, I am excited to continue building my skills, connecting with others in the tech community, and making meaningful contributions to this ever-evolving field.</p>
